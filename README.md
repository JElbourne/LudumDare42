# The Cave In
Finding yourself trapped in a small mine shaft deep below the surface, you realise you don't have much time. The ceiling is starting to collapse making this small room even smaller. You are running out of space and need to do something.

You realize you can use the <Arrow Keys> to Move around the cave, and even push the boulders around.

You had heard tales of this magical cave and its powers to make things disappear, perhaps I am the caves next victim and I will disappear. No, Let's stay positive. The tale mentioned something about if 4 boulders are perfectly aligned in a row they will vanish right before your eyes. Although not every boulder will work the same way.

In a burst of self-motivating monologue, you remind yourself that someone will come for you, You just need to survive long enough. Even if they can't get down to you right away, they may be able to assist with dynamite!
